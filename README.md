# **ðŸŒ¦ Weather Forecast Dashboard**

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyse and visualise weather trends. This project combines real-time weather data with advanced visuals to present key metrics such as temperature forecasts, rainfall probability, and air quality levels.

## ðŸ“Œ *Project Overview*

The purpose of this project is to provide a clear and engaging overview of weather conditions across cities, supported by forecasts and air quality insights. Designed as a portfolio showcase, it highlights both data storytelling and dashboard design skills.

## ðŸ”— *Data Source*

Weather API: weatherapi.com

Data refreshed automatically to capture live updates.

## ðŸ“Š *Features & Dashboards*

Current Weather Overview

Live temperature updates and conditions (e.g. cloudy, rain, clear).

Quick city comparisons for multiple locations.

Temperature Forecast

7-day temperature trends shown through an interactive line chart.

Air Quality Index (AQI)

Breakdown of pollutants: PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, O3 and NO2.

AQI classification into health bands (e.g. Good, Moderate, Poor).

Chance of Rain

Probability of rainfall by day, highlighted for risk assessment.

Additional Indicators

Humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, UV index and precipitation.

Sunrise and sunset times for better context.
